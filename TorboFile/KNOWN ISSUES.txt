***
* Animated GIF previews do not play at the speeds encoded by the GIF.
***

I have not yet looked into querying the meta-data within a GIF in order
to play an animated GIF at the intended speeds.

This should be addressed in a future release.


***
* Systems running .NET framework versions lower than 4.6.2 ignore file paths
* whose total character length is greater than 259.
***

This is a limitation of older versions of the .NET Framework, and is not worth
my time to fix. Upgrading your installed .NET Framework to version 4.6.2 or
higher should fix the issue. Fewer and fewer applications will support the older
frameworks as time goes on, so unless you're having unrelated compatibility
issues, there's no reason not to upgrade.


***
* File Previews are choppy / Lack View options.
***

TorboFile is a File Organizer and not intended to function as a general text or
media viewer. File previews are only provided to give a general idea of the
contents of a given file, and I do not anticipate they will ever be fully featured
components.

That being said, I will to continue to improve these aspects of the program in
future versions, so long as users express interest in my doing so.
Expect improvements to be incremental, and not monumental.


***
* I have no game, no life, no money
***

Issue is not expected to be addressed in any foreseeable update.
